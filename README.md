# Sorting-Visualizer
A sorting visualizer is an interactive tool that graphically demonstrates sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe how elements are rearranged to achieve a desired order. It helps understand algorithm efficiency and performance through visual representation, making it an invaluable resource for learning and analyzing sorting techniques.
